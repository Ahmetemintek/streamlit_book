# Extended Markdown

The extended markdown convention created for `streamlit book` provides format for creating the following activities and quizzes:
* To do list
* True or False
* Multiple choice
* Single choice
* Text input
* Code input
* File input

Additionally, each activity and quizz type has a function, so it can also be called directly. 

This can be useful if you want to stack several quizzes and python code into the same page. Having more than one quizz per markdown is not currently supported in the implementation.
