# About this project

For PyCon Chile (Nov 2021) I did a presentation about streamlit, where I use streamlit as a PowerPoint replacement. 

Actually, it felt more like jupyter notebook and rise extension replacement, since I do all of my technical talks using that framework. 
I've been using jupyter notebooks for sharing code, as interactive as possible with python and some widgets. 

It was a great coding exercise, but there were lots and lots of code involved.
Not an experience that could be easily teached, reproduced and maintained by teachers for a given class. 

Streamlit is great for self learning, so it seems more reasonable to use it as book, same as the jupyter book project. 
The main idea is to allow teachers to create content more easily through markdown and (maybe) code, allowing student to freely explore content and interactive code.
