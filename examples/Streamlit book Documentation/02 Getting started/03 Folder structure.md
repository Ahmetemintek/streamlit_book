# How it works

The main idea behind `streamlit_book` is that it uses a strong convention of the folder structures.
It will render checkboxes to dynamically explore the folders, allowing to render python and markdown files (`.py` and `.md`).
It will exclude the files and folders that start with preffix `WIP`, which i reserved files and folders that are still **work in progress**.
