Introduction
============

streamlit_book is a (hopefully simpler) way to create streamlit apps using python/markdown and folder convention.

Capabilities
--------------------

* Reads and renders markdown and python files on the provided folders.
* Navigation: 
    * Chapter: previous, next and reload (customizable) buttons
    * Book: lateral menu to access different chapters
* Predefined activities, from python or markdown:
    * true or false question
    * single choice question
    * multiple choice question
    * to do list 
* User answers to provided questions can (optionally) be saved.
* User's token: users can continue his session (and we can store his answers, if needed).
* Admin view: you get some stats on users and answers.

Why is it interesting?
-------------------------

Because a teacher does not need to (necesarily) know about streamlit to create a streamlit book. 
It only needs to create a folder structure and edit markdown files. 
And he even can add streamlit interactive apps, activities and quizzes!
