# About the book

This book is provided as a streamlit app, and documents the streamlit_book framework.

## Where can I find it?
The repository is online at https://github.com/sebastiandres/streamlit_book

## How does it works?
* It requires a strict folder convention
* Reads and renders the selected markdown or python file in streamlit.

## Why is it interesting?

Because a teacher does not need to (necesarily) know about streamlit to create a streamlit book.
It only needs to create a folder structure and edit markdown files.
Buuuut, it can add streamlit interactive apps, activities and quizzes!
